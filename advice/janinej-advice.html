			<h4>Just a Little Bit</h4>
			<p>Like learning anything, consistency is the key to coding. Doing a little bit every day will vastly improve your skills than doing a coding "dump" once a month.</p>

			<p>Set aside a few minutes each day- even 10 minutes will do- to go over a concept that you're unclear of or to work on a Skillcrush lesson. The great thing about the Skillcrush videos is that they're short. The majority of them are less than seven minutes. So have your laptop beside you while watch Scandal or How to Get Away with Murder and during commercials, practice your coding!</p>

			<h4>Mentor!</h4>
			<p>Some famous person once said that by helping others, you help yourself. This is true, even when you're learning to code. One of the best ways to get clear on a concept is to teach it someone else. </p>

			<p>I recommend that you start mentoring as early in your coding journey as you can. Don't worry about not knowing everything or not knowing enough. Think back to your first Skillcrush class, when you didn't know what HTML stood for. There are people in that boat and you can help them!</p>

			<p>There are a lot of beginner HTML/CSS classes for adults and kids, many of them only a few hours long on the weekend. Find one and mentor! Believe me, there's someone who <em>needs</em> your help! I once volunteered to mentor a Photoshop class, because they were short-staffed. Disclaimer: I don't know Photoshop. </p>

			<p>Do you know what? It was great! I ended up helping a table of people who were, not only, brand new to Photoshop, but brand new to computers! They were having trouble downloading files and opening folders. I didn't know Photoshop well, but that I knew. </p>

			<p>Since they were very beginners, we, as a table, took our time. While the other participants were able to move ahead, my table was okay going at a slower pace, because there was a mentor there to help them with their beginner questions.</p>

			<p>The great thing about mentoring is that you'll learn a lot, too. There'll be a wide range of experiences and you can learn from other mentors. Plus, it's fun! </p>
